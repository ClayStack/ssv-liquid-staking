## What it does?

The SSV Liquid Staking Framework is a set of smart contracts that allow users to deposit Ether into a contract and receive an ERC20 token, ssvETH, in return. The contract then stakes the Ether in the consensus layer and the user's ssvETH represents their stake in the contract. Users can withdraw their Ether at any time by burning their ssvETH.
